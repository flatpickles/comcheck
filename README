comcheck 0.1

comcheck is a simple script to check the availability of .com domain names.

Single check:
>>    python comcheck.py
      provides a prompt where you can enter your desired domain. Do not
      include the .com
>>    python comcheck.py test
      checks the availability of "test.com"

Bulk check:
>>    python comcheck.py
      checks for a dict.txt file in the local directory, and reads
      individual lines of this as potential names, checking each.
      The available names are written to available.txt, and if the
      script execution is canceled (ctrl+c), the current index into
      dict.txt is saved in last.txt. When run next, if last.txt
      exists, checking automatically continues from that index.
